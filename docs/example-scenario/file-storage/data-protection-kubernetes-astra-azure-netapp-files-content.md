With containerized applications, it can be challenging to protect data and perform stateful backups. When you deploy business-critical workloads on Kubernetes, application backup and recovery should be:

- Simple. Establishing data protection policies and on-demand backups should be intuitive. These policies and backups shouldn't be dependent on the details of the underlying infrastructure.
- Portable. To make cross-region mobility possible for applications, multiple Kubernetes clusters should be able to consume the backups.
- Application-aware. Your solution should protect the entire application, including standard Kubernetes resources like secrets, ConfigMaps, and persistent volumes. You also need to protect custom Kubernetes resources. When possible, backup and recovery procedures should quiesce the application. This practice prevents the loss of in-flight data during backups.

This article outlines a solution that uses [NetApp Astra Control Service][Astra Control Service] for data protection, disaster recovery, and application mobility. This solution is appropriate for stateful applications that run on [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)]. Astra Control Service provides stateful AKS workloads with a rich set of storage and application-aware data management services. The data protection technology of [Azure NetApp Files][Azure NetApp Files] underlies these services.

## Potential use cases

This solution applies to systems that run stateful applications:

- Continuous integration (CI) systems such as Jenkins
- Database workloads like MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL
- AI and machine-learning components such as TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Elasticsearch deployments
- Kafka applications
- Source code management platforms like GitLab

### Dataflow

1. An Azure NetApp Files account is created on an Azure subscription, and capacity pools are defined. These pools map to service levels that the implementation needs, such as Standard, Premium, and Ultra.

1. One or more AKS clusters are deployed. The clusters need to be:

   - In a region where AKS and Azure NetApp Files are available. For regions where these products are available, see [Products available by region][Products available by region].
   - In a virtual network that has direct access to a subnet that's delegated for Azure NetApp Files. For more information, see [Guidelines for Azure NetApp Files network planning][Guidelines for Azure NetApp Files network planning - Subnets].

1. A user signs up for an Astra Control Service account. Astra Control Service uses a *service principal* that has contributor access to locate the AKS clusters. A service principal is an Azure service account. Astra Control Service uses Astra Trident to create Kubernetes storageClasses that map to the Azure NetApp Files capacity pools. The mapping takes into account the service level of the capacity pools. This step doesn't use Azure or Kubernetes role-based access control.

1. The user installs applications on the AKS clusters. Possible deployment methods include Helm charts, operators, and YAML manifests that are grouped by labels or namespaces. Astra Control Service provisions persistent volumes on the storageClasses.

1. Astra Control Service manages applications and their associated resources, such as pods, services, deployments, and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) objects. Users define applications by using one of these methods:

   - Confining them to a namespace
   - Using a custom Kubernetes label to group resources
   - Deploying them with Helm3 in a namespace

   Astra Control Service orchestrates [point-in-time snapshots][What volume snapshots are], [backup policies][Understand Azure NetApp Files backup], and [instant active clones][Restoring (cloning) an online snapshot to a new volume] to protect application workloads. Astra Control Service achieves this protection by:

    - Creating Astra Control Service protection policies that specify a schedule and backup target. These policies make it possible to automatically back up applications.
    - Taking snapshots on demand for individual applications.
    - Making instantaneous backups or clones for individual applications.

   When disasters or app failures occur, backups and snapshots restore applications' state. Users can clone and migrate apps across namespaces and AKS clusters. The clusters can be in the same or separate regions.

### Components

- [AKS][AKS] is a fully managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to deploy and manage containerized applications. AKS offers serverless Kubernetes technology, an integrated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) experience, and enterprise-grade security and governance.
- [Azure NetApp Files][Azure NetApp Files service page] is an Azure storage service. This service provides enterprise-grade network file system (NFS) and server message block (SMB) file shares. Azure NetApp Files makes it easy to migrate and run complex, file-based applications with no code changes. This service is well suited for users with persistent volumes in Kubernetes environments.
- [Azure Virtual Network][Azure Virtual Network] is the fundamental building block for private networks in Azure. Through Virtual Network, Azure resources like VMs can securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
- [Astra Control Service][Astra Control Service] is a fully managed application-aware data management service. Astra Control Service manages, protects, and moves data-rich Kubernetes workloads in public clouds and on-premises environments. This service provides data protection, disaster recovery, and migration for Kubernetes workloads. Astra Control Service uses the industry-leading [data management technology of Azure NetApp Files for snapshots, backups, cross-region replication, and cloning][How Azure NetApp Files snapshots work].

### Alternatives

You can use a custom multi-pronged approach to separately back up or replicate persistent volumes, Kubernetes resources, and other configuration state resources that you need when you restore an application. But this approach can be:

- Cumbersome.
- Difficult to make compatible with all apps.
- Difficult to scale across the multiple apps and environments that a typical enterprise has.

In certain environments, you can reduce costs by avoiding cross-peered virtual network traffic. To eliminate this traffic, simplify the solution. Specifically, bring the AKS clusters and the subnet that you delegate for Azure NetApp Files into the same virtual network, as this diagram illustrates:

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-protection-kubernetes-astra-azure-netapp-files-single.png" alt-text="Architecture diagram that shows how to use A K S with Astra Control Service in a single virtual network." border="false" lightbox="./media/data-protection-kubernetes-astra-azure-netapp-files-single.svg":::

*Download a [Visio file][Visio version of architecture diagram that uses a single virtual network] of this architecture.*

## Considerations

Keep these points in mind when you use this solution.

### Managing

The way you discover and manage applications depends on the way you deploy and identify them. Typical identification strategies include grouping application objects in a dedicated namespace, assigning labels to objects that make up an application, and using Helm charts. Astra Control Service supports all three strategies. Before you define protection policies, clearly identify your workloads. An essential prerequisite is that Astra Control Service can uniquely detect each application. For more information, see [Manage apps][Manage apps].

### Monitoring

When you work with the Kubernetes control plane, it's important to monitor your infrastructure and platform layer. Astra Control Service provides a unified control plane that you can use to define and manage application protection policies across multiple AKS clusters. A [dashboard][View a summary of app and cluster health] provides a way for you to continuously handle workloads across regions. Astra Trident also provides a rich set of [Prometheus metrics][Monitor Astra Trident] that you can use to monitor provisioned storage.

### Scalability

AKS clusters can add extra worker nodes to increase scalability. To scale your solution, you can add node pools or scale existing node pools. These steps increase the number of nodes in your cluster, the total number of cores, and the memory that's available for your containerized applications.

In each virtual network, you can only delegate one subnet for Azure NetApp Files.

When you use a basic configuration for Azure NetApp Files network features, there's a limit of 1,000 IP addresses per virtual network. The standard network features configuration doesn't limit the number of IP addresses.  For more information, see [Configurable network features][Configurable network features]. For a complete list of resource limits for Azure NetApp Files, see [Resource limits for Azure NetApp Files][Resource limits for Azure NetApp Files].

### Availability

When you deploy an AKS cluster, you deploy it in a single region. To protect application workloads, it's best to deploy the workloads across [multiple AKS clusters that span multiple regions][AKS baseline for multiregion clusters]. Factors that affect deployment include [AKS region availability][Region availability] and Azure [paired regions][Cross-region replication in Azure: Business continuity and disaster recovery]. When you deploy clusters across multiple availability zones, you distribute nodes across multiple zones within a single region. This distribution of AKS cluster resources improves cluster availability because the clusters are resilient to the failure of a specific zone.

Azure NetApp Files is highly available by design. It's built on a highly available bare-metal fleet of all flash storage systems. For this service's availability guarantee, see [SLA for Azure NetApp Files][SLA for Azure NetApp Files].

Azure NetApp Files supports cross-region replication for disaster recovery. You can replicate volumes between Azure region pairs continuously. For more information on cross-region replication, see these resources:

- For general information, see [Cross-region replication of Azure NetApp Files volumes][Cross-region replication of Azure NetApp Files volumes].
- For requirements for cross-region replication, see [Manage disaster recovery using cross-region replication][Manage disaster recovery using cross-region replication].
- For information on configuring cross-region replication, see [Create volume replication for Azure NetApp Files][Create volume replication for Azure NetApp Files].

### Performance

Azure NetApp Files offers multiple performance tiers. When you use Astra Control Service to discover AKS clusters, the onboarding process creates curated storageClasses that map to the Standard, Premium, and Ultra service tiers. When users deploy applications, they choose a storage tier that suits their requirements. Multiple capacity pools can coexist. Provisioned volumes have a performance guarantee that corresponds to the service tier. For a list of service levels that Azure NetApp Files supports, see [Service levels for Azure NetApp Files][Service levels for Azure NetApp Files].
